## Introduction
In this project, we have built a Web App using Python Dash to display Healthcare Orgnization (Hospitals, Doctors' Clinics, Nursing Homes, etc.) Communities running in Google GCP App Runner. The visualizations include the communities' locations, domographics, network metrics, network topology, and top rated doctors. The Web App can be served as a guideline tool for users to find doctors and their affiliated orgnizations in a certain geographic area. Web Interface Screenshot:
