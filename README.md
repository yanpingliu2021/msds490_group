# NU MSDS498 Capstone Group Project

Healthcare Organization Shared Doctor Affiliation Network Community Detection and Visualization

## Team Members

## Introduction

In this project, we have built a Web App using Python Dash to display Healthcare Orgnization (Hospitals, Doctors' Clinics, Nursing Homes, etc.) Communities running in Google GCP App Runner. The visualizations include the communities' locations, domographics, network metrics, network topology, and top rated doctors. The Web App can be served as a guideline tool for users to find doctors and their affiliated orgnizations in a certain geographic area.

### Shared Doctor Network

We construct the organization affiliation network based on shared doctors. As long as two organizations shared one common doctor, they establish a link in the network. Below chart illustrates how the network is constructed:

### Community Detection

In network science, a community in a graph is defined as a subset of nodes that are densely connected to each other and loosely connected to the nodes in the other communities in the same graph. In terms the shared doctor organization network constructed in this project, a healthcare organization community can be viewed as a group of organizations shared common doctors and
